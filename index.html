                <h3>Aaron Lev</h3>



                “Start with something simple and small, then expand over time. If people call it a ‘toy’ you’re definitely onto something.” “If you’re waiting for encouragement from others, you’re doing it wrong. By the time people think an idea is good, it’s probably
                too late.”


                <h3>Akshat Paul</h3>
                (A software developer and writer.) “User interface is the process of shifting from chaotic complexity to elegant simplicity.”


                <h3>Alan Cooper</h3>
                (An American programmer and software designer, known as the father of Visual Basic.) “If we want users to like our software, we should design it to behave like a likeable person.” “Define what the product will do before you design how the product will
                do it.” “Usability’s strength is in identifying problems, while design’s strength is in identifying solutions.”


                <h3>Alan Kay</h3>
                (An American computer scientist known for his pioneering work in PC, object-oriented programming and GUI design.) “The best way to predict the future is to invent it.” “Every technology really needs to be shipped with a special manual – not how to use
                it but why, when and for what.”


                <h3>Alan Perlis</h3>
                (An American computer scientist and professor, known for his groundbreaking work on programming languages ​​and also the first winner of the Turing Award.) “A language that doesn’t affect the way you think about programming is not worth knowing.” “Fools
                ignore complexity. Pragmatists suffer it. Some can avoid it. Geniuses remove it.” “If art interprets our dreams, the computer executes them in the guise of programs!”


                <h3>Alan Turing</h3>
                (A famous British mathematician, computer scientist, cryptologist, considered as the founder of computer science, laid the conceptual foundation of modern computers with the Turing machine, Turing Award, accepted the Nobel of computer science, is given
                annually in his name)
